# dylancasabona-portfolio

## Description

- Not only a project, but another opportunity to test my abilities; Making my own developer portfolio from scratch with an emphasis on CSS and responsiveness. 
- This page will be an ongoing project recieving updates. Currently displays 2 linsk to projects I have completed within the course. And at the bottom, a contact info box containing my email, github, linkedin, and freecodecamp profiles. 

## Usage

- The header contains 2 in-page link shortcuts, taking you directly to those sections(will be more useful when there is more content)
- The deployed projects sections small images of the deployed work, which also act as links to the deployed projects. 
- The contact info box at the bottom has a minor hover effect that will then reveal the listed contact info beneath.
